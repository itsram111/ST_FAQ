### FAQ

Do you have any question check below

```markdown

Ans: Whenever there is an update on Socia Trade site we deactivate extension temporarily and enable again after verifying the same. So It's temporary deactivation only.

- Q6: when Mobile version is coming?
Ans: We had already sent our code for publishing and it was in the queue but before that itself due to changes in the server we need to republish and yes we will be in a longer queue again.
- Q7: Why Google Chrome disable/remove your extension
Ans: As it's not from webstore Google chrome removing that extension. And It's not easy to put the extension on Google Chrome. we have to buy the license for it. The temporary solution you can install the extension in UC Browser, Chromium browser.
- Q8: Why waiting time is not reduced less than 30 secs.
Ans: It's for good reason only. I see the only way ST can track down your work is scripted is based on time between two clicks.
